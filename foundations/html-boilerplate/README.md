# HTML Boilerplate Memory Exercise

## Overview
This assignment focuses on building muscle memory for writing HTML boilerplate code. The goal is to practice writing the basic HTML document structure from memory, which is a fundamental skill for web development.

## Assignment Task

1. Open the `index.html` file
2. Delete all existing content in the file
3. Write out the complete HTML boilerplate structure from memory
4. Verify your work by checking if you included all necessary elements

## Required Elements

Your boilerplate should include:
- DOCTYPE declaration
- HTML element with language attribute
- Head section with:
  - Character encoding (meta charset)
  - Title element
- Body element

## Tips for Practice

1. Try to write the boilerplate multiple times
2. Pay attention to:
   - Proper nesting of elements
   - Correct spelling of declarations
   - Required attributes (like `lang="en"`)
   - Proper use of quotation marks
3. Practice until you can write it without referring to any reference

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting the DOCTYPE declaration
- Missing the language attribute
- Incorrect spelling of "charset"
- Improper nesting of head/body elements
- Missing closing tags

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Write the HTML boilerplate from memory
- Understand the purpose of each element in the boilerplate
- Create new HTML files quickly without relying on code generators

## Verification

To check if your boilerplate is correct, ensure:
1. The file renders correctly in a browser
2. There are no syntax errors
3. All required elements are present
4. Elements are properly nested
